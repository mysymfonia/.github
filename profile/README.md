## Hi there üëã
## Backend Developer Training 
üôã‚Äç The aim of this training program is to acquire programming skills in ASP.NET Core, one of the most popular and versatile frameworks for creating modern, efficient web applications.

Here's what you can expect from this training:

1. Introduction to ASP.NET Core: At the start of the training, participants will be introduced to the basics of ASP.NET Core, an open-source framework used for building web applications. They will learn how to create and run simple applications, manage routing, and handle requests.
2. Using Entity Framework: Entity Framework is an ORM (Object Relational Mapping) that allows you to work with databases in an object-oriented way. Participants will learn how to define models, use DBContext, perform queries, and manage relationships between objects.
3. Mediator Pattern: The mediator pattern helps manage complex communications between objects. Participants will learn how to implement this pattern in ASP.NET Core, allowing them to create applications that are easier to maintain and expand.
4. Exploration of REST API: REST API is a fundamental element of modern web applications. Participants will delve into creating and consuming REST APIs, handling different types of requests (GET, POST, DELETE, etc.), and managing data in JSON format.
5. Understanding GraphQL API: GraphQL is a modern API that allows clients to precisely define the data they want to receive. Participants will engage with creating a GraphQL API, defining schemas, handling queries, mutations, and subscriptions.

üßô Throughout this training, participants will work on specific tasks that will help them understand and learn all of the above concepts. By the end of the training, they will be able to create complex web applications using ASP.NET Core.
